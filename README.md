Welcome to Ski Game!

Use the arrow keys to move and the spacebar to jump.

This game was inspired by the old Microsoft Ski Free Game.

I used keymaster.js to handle user inputs. The GameView class passes this to the Game class which moves the skier horizontally and the rest of the objects vertically.

Avoid the trees or you will surely crash!
